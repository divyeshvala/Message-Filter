# Spam Detector For SMS Messages
## A simple message classifier using Naive Bayes theorem.

### Idea
* It is an web application to check whether SMS messages are spam or not. Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm has been used to classify messages.

### Overview
* In this project I have trained a Naive Bayes ML model to detect spam messages. 
* The dataset I have used to train the model is a collection of SMS messages tagged as spam or ham that can be found on kaggle. [ Here ](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
* I have created an API for the model, using Flask, the Python micro framework to use it on the web application.
* There are two frontend web pages built using HTML and CSS to showcase working of this ML model.
